# Unhandled File Processing Error in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: failing to handle potential errors when processing files.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to read and process a file without checking if it exists. This can lead to script failure.

The `bugSolution.sh` script shows how to properly handle this error using error checking and appropriate messages.
